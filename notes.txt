Ethical Computing:

* Philosophical Waning on Ethics

* Intent vs Results
  - https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/887792727160537090
  - not as simple as doing the right thing

* Unconcious Bias
  - some people believe that software is apolotical
  - some people believe that algorithms cannot have bias

* What has bias?
  - Products
  - Software has bias
  - Code has bias
  - Design has bias
  - Algorithms have bias
  - the things we make suffer from our own biases

* Responsible for your products: people can die (not as compelling as originally thought)
  - history of airbags
  - mostly calibrated for 1 body size.
  - lack of diversity
  - good intent bad result
  - since 1990
  - Only 175 documented fatalities since 1990?
    - Women + Children disproportionately affected... but not obvious just yet how bad this really is.

* Resonsible for your products: legally liable
  - VW emissions
    - people went to jail
  - bad intent bad result
  
* Responsible for your products: democracy on hard mode
  -cambridge analytics
    - what are you trying to democratise
    - this is a tough one

* Responsible for you products: re-inforcing system opression
  - photography -> face recognition software
    - emulsions made for white skin
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d16LNHIEJzs
    - sensors are not as accurate with darker skin

* Homework
  - Ask yourself:
    - what am I making?
    - who am I making it for

* Neil Postmansâ€™s 6 questions???
  - What is the problem to which this technology is the solution?
  - Whose problem is it?
  - Which people and what institutions will be most seriously harmed by this new technology?
  - What new problems might be created by solving the original problem?
  - What sort of people and institutions gain special economic and political power from this new technology?
  - What changes in language are being forced by these new technologies?
  
* Who are we to make these decsions?

* Doing right in the real world
  - lots of different ideas of right + wrong
  - not a lot of data
  - not clear what the data is
  
Three layers of ethics

* meta ethics
  - What does it mean to call something right or wrong
  - How do we decide
* Normative ethics
  - What standards or rules are the right one's to follow
* Applied Ethics
  - How do our existing rules apply to this situation/
  
* Some say we should judge by consequences
* Some will say we have to follow rules or rights
* Virtue ethics: what kind of human being we want to be?

* Reflective Equilibrium
  - balance between moral principal and your impression of specific cases of right / wrong
   - it is your hyprocacy of wanting to end suffering while still eating a hamburger
   - This struggle can be the spark to lasting change
   
* Ethics cannot be codified
  - you cannot lower error rates and remove systemic opression
  - The problems lie just outside your model
* Saying no doesn't require a formula
* You are far away from the people who we affect and we need to appraoch that with care
* Setting examples for others
